I've been playing with the new changes to talents that we've seen in 7.1.5 and so far, I can't really say I'm pleased with the results thus far so here's my feedback on the current (and certain previous)changes to Affliction and talent in general. - Drain Life being switched with Drain Soul: I won't lie, myself like many others felt that the Drain Soul we'd be getting would be the one we have on live, not one that deals 3% less damage than Drain Life does on live. Drain Life on Live: 270,777 over 4.9 seconds Drain Soul on the PTR: 262,826 over 4.9 seconds Seeing as Secret of the Necrolyte isn't on the PTR, I doubt that this is just a bug and it feels more like an actual nerf which means we just trade a green beam for a purple one and also a huge nerf survability wise, seeing as Drain Soul heals for 30% less than its green counterpart, a nerf which comes on top of the switch of talents that made Demon Skin being unable to be picked with Dark Pact and for that nerf we get a soul shard on defeat. A very disappointing change, if intended. If not, I hope the damage will be increase to match the one we have on Live as Affliction could desperately use some form of single target damage increase. - Reworked Haunt: The talent itself seems way contradictory. It feels like it was designed for quick burst on short lived adds, which at first seems nice until you go to the part where it also increases our damage against that target by 10% for 15 seconds. The bad thing with that is that for one, short lived adds never last the 15 seconds so by the time the add spawn and that Haunt reaches it, we have no DoTs on the target yet and it's already close to being dead which leaves us to maybe (depending on our current shards) being able to cast an Unstable Affliction and having a very slight buff to it or just Drain Soul then see the add die. Being able to do so little as Affliction during that short time frame (due to Affliction terrible ramp up issues), it just feel like that part of the talent is close to being entirely wasted. In the rare case they do live more than 15 seconds, an Agony by itself will be a better use of a Global, especially if we took Writhe in Agony which just makes it in the end a very confusing change. If we take that talent in single target, it's just a slightly less than 5% damage buff to our shadow damage(taking into account its cooldown, duration and missile speed which also means by the way that it cannot even benefit from its own effect) if we use it as soon as it comes off of CD, which doesn't even compare to Writhe in Agony, which is clearly a talent that trumps in ease of use, general usefulness and damage throughput. Writhe in Agony: A very powerful talent, it just needs to be baseline as nothing can really compete with it on its row without severely gutting it, which would only create even more issues to a spec riddled with them. Reworked Malefic Grasp: This current iteration of Malefic Grasp is....quite sad when you see what it used to be. It lost its ability to proc DoTs which means that we cannot use it to help fish for Compounding Horror(which I will come to later) procs nor can it help Agony proc which would help to reduce Affliction's horrendous ramp up time. It also play terribly with Soul Effigy as you're effectively inputting less damage into it which means less damage done by Effigy overall while not helping our already low channeling usage, which we often have to break for mechanics. I feel the only solution for it is to bring back its old iteration, like it was in MoP, tune it accordingly and make it replace Soul Effigy or if that does not happen, at the very least change its position in the talent tree as it is clearly a bad talent for the first row. I wouldn't even mind seeing it take Howl of Terror's spot Demonic Circle: Needs to be brought back baseline. It's been a signature spell for Warlocks for a long time and right now in its current iteration, it's literally broken if you want to place your portal at different location mid encounter(unless you make a macro for it but I feel making a macro to make a spell behave like it's supposed to is bad design). Put Burning Rush in its spot and Dark Bargain in Burning Rush's previous location (would also help with the mentioned doubling down on strengths, seeing as it is a survability talent). Contagion: I feel that for a talent which you need to monitor to be able to keep an high up time on, it lacks throughput. Absolute Corruption, while being a clearly designed multi-target talent is only ~2% under it on single target and that's theoretically speaking. In a real world scenario, the saved global and its ability to be there permanently makes that 2% even less. I think it should at the very least have its previous nerf reverted.", "author": "Annointer"}

I am the Director/Host/Producer of FinalBossTV & I have been playing Enhancement as my main since the space goats fell from the sky. We have come a very long way, with Legion, from the old designs of Enhancement's past...but with all change comes new problems that require solutions. Detailed in this post are some of the top concerns put together by a handful of Enhancement players from around the world that have kept in communication since MoP about the state of the class. We just hope to make it the best it can be and it\u2019s understandable that some talents have issues since the focus in Legion was the core of the class. (*Years playing Enhancement.) Credits: Wordup <Echoes> | 9 Years Played Purge <Addiction> | Lots of Years Played Rusahh <Addiction> | 5 Years Played Hekili <Turbo Cyborg Ninjas> | 3 Years Played Ryethe <Midwinter> | 8 Years Played Bay <Crisp> | 9 Years Played------------------------------------------------ Talent: Ascendance Problem - Ascendance is too unreliable to be our major cooldown option in the 100 talent tier. When receiving many Stormbringer procs the ability is very fun to use, but more often than not we receive very few. When receiving no Stormbringer procs during its duration we only get 1-2 uses of windstrike during the duration. This ability has no protection against poor RNG which makes it a poor talent choice over the consistent bonus provided by Landslide\u2019s Agility. Additionally, the maelstrom generation it provides is redundant as we are usually overflowing with maelstrom from other effects during the duration and having more maelstrom that we can\u2019t even spend in most cases - permanently being capped and unable to spend/dump - does not feel very rewarding at all. Cooldowns, by design, need to be reliable for burn periods. Suggestions - A) Change the maelstrom generation to either a lower cooldown on Windstrike, 4.0 - 6.0 base CD would both allow for a minimum of 3-4 Windstrikes even at lower levels of haste which would increase the use of our major button while ascended. B) Or change the passive to be something similar to Metamorphosis with a passive haste bonus that would allow for a higher chance to proc Stormbringer with auto attacks, allowing for more maelstrom generation with said auto attacks, and lowering the cooldown of Windstrike naturally because of the added haste granted while ascended. Goal - The purpose of either, or a mix of, these suggestions is to bring Ascendance up in reliability as a talent choice for actual Burst Damage. Currently it \"can\" do that only if you have good RNG. And having to rely on a chance to do good burst, and then be on cool down for 2 minutes 45 seconds, is not very impactful. The Shaman should feel powerful while Ascendance is active. Currently you do not unless the dice gods smile upon you and you have feel-good Stormbringer RNG. There is already a hefty load of RNG in the base rotation from: Stormbringer + Stormflurry, Unleash Doom and Feral Spirits. (Due to their elemental bonuses not being controllable/not equal in effectiveness.) Talent: Sundering Problem - Sundering does not have scaling factors to keep it in line with Crashing Storm and Fury of Air. Currently it scales in physical damage based on Attack Power. There is no Mastery or Haste scaling, which the other two talent options have. Crashing Storm: AP / Haste / Mastery / Vers / Crit (as Nature Damage) Fury of Air: AP / Haste (Uptime) / Mastery / Vers / Crit (as Nature Damage) Sundering: AP / Vers / Crit (as Physical Damage, reduced by armor) Suggestions - Add both Mastery and Haste scaling. Convert spell to Fire or mixed spell damage school. Allow 2 charges to separate it as our burst AoE option. Goal - Enhancement is severely lacking in the Burst AoE category and this is a great place to do it. Re-tune damage as needed around these changes. And yes, not all Classes/Specs need to have every option available but it's damage is so minimal due to being physical it would need to be buffed by 80% or more to make it compete (in it's current state) with Crashing Storm or Fury of Air.

{"url": "/forums/en/wow/topic/20752489932", "title": "Quick question", "replies": "2", "first_post": "The recent PTR updates to Warriors, specifically the fury specialisation really miss the mark in terms of talents. Fresh Meat - Bumping this up to 60% increased crit to Bloodthirst still doesn't make it worth using ever for the fact that the first 20% of an enemy's health is always the fastest point as everyone is using their cooldowns and Heroism / Bloodlust is in effect completely nullifying any effect this talent will have over the superior Endless Rage or War Machine. Outburst - It's a joke that reducing it to a 45s CD is what is defined as acceptable for talent balance. This will never compete with Avatar or Wrecking Ball unless some extravagant effect is added on top. Reckless Abandon - I like the change to this, providing a slightly higher Battle Cry uptime, however the fact that the rage is still given in one large chunk with fury only having a rage cap of 100 is still not productive. Reckless Abandon in conjunction with providing an extra 2s to Battle Cry's duration should also grant 50 rage on use and a further 50 rage over 3s. What this will allow is for rage to not be wasted as Fury already generates a large amount of rage with their opening charge, this will also make the talent more attractive. You've proved with the new guardian legendary Oakheart's Puny Quods that you can do this. Dragon Roar - The nerf is unwarrented, given that Reckless Abandon is on par with it in terms of damage on live where Dragon Roar provides a playstyle players enjoy and provides a boost to AoE throughput. Massacre - Why is this not baseline still? You stated you were looking to make certain talents that were required for a spec to function baseline and this hasn't been adjusted yet? It's literally the ONLY option to take on it's tier to make pressing execute over rampage sub 20% even worth it. Juggernaut - It's 5% damage increase per stack up to 99 is totally not required. For one it takes way too long for the Fury Warrior to build up their execute to a respectable level. The stacks should be limited to a maximum of 10/20 and it's buff to be increased so the warrior doesn't lose a massive stack of juggernaut because they had to react to a mechanic which is upsetting when it occurs. Double Time - Another talent that should be baseline for both Arms and Fury, it's complete garbage having to choose between a mobility vs a stun. No other class has this decision to make and for a great reason it's silly. What should replace it? Warbringer of course allowing for all warrior specs to choose between Shockwave / Storm Bolt or Charge Stun. This will in no way make Warriors overpowered as their only baseline CC is a 90s AoE fear. Blood Bath - It's cool down @ 30s is a big issue in the fact that it doesn't line up with Battle Cry which in itself is a 50s CD after taking Helya's Wrath. The DoT effect is also too long as it takes 12s to get the most out of the bleed effect, even in a mythic raid setting on prog most AoE sections don't last this long therefore damage is wasted. Now if the DoT effect was set to 3s it would be more reasonable as you would be able to get it's full effect within 9s. Frenzy - Fury loves haste, why do we never spec into this talent? For one reason only, Furious Slash is barely ever used so keeping up this haste buff is a chore and not worth it. How could this be fixed? By allowing either Bloodthirst or Rampage to refresh the Frenzy effect and Furious Slash to stack it, this allows for a better playstyle for the warrior as the only time Frenzy will drop off is if the warrior is not keeping on target. If you insist on Frenzy only being applied by Furious Slash, make this talent merge Raging Blow and Furious Slash into a 1 button filler attack that deals Medium damage providing a haste buff and the bloodthirsty effect (animation would be alternating MH / OH slashes much like in d3). Bladestorm - A once iconic ability now in the dog house never to be used by another Fury Warrior in Legion as it's not able to be covered completely by enrage. How do we fix this? Make bladestorm always deal damage as if enraged, if you would like make an aura that applies enrage so the Fury warrior who is bladestorming is also susceptible to an increased damage intake. It's cool down could also be lowered to ~50s to line up with battle cry a little better. Rampage - It's 2s GCD/\"channel\" isn't exactly the best interaction in a spec as it's reduced awkwardly by haste. This also causes some poor interactions with short term buffs such as Battle Cry as using it under said windows lowers your total GCDs in the window at the expense of using an ability with mediocre damage. This in turn also lowers it's synergy with Reckless Abandon / Dragon Roar if used within them. Fixing any of the above issues would be a huge step in fixing a broken talent tree that's sorely needing some love mechanically for the Fury Warrior.", "author": "Idiotgodx"}

The problem that I see with ES regardless of the buff is that it does not benefit from echo of the highlord, whereas TV does, in addition to being buffed substantially by the final verdict talent, and most importantly ES has extreme anti-synergy with our bis legendary, cloak of the nathrezim. I have the cloak, and while I haven't tested it with the buffed ES on the PTR, just playing with ES on live feels really bad when you have the cloak, because using it on CD more often than not wastes the TV buff from your cloak buff (not to mention a substantial dps loss). I don't know if buffed ES does competitive dps even with the cloak, but the mere fact that it feels inefficient to use with the legendary cloak makes me not want to take it. This disappoints me, because I was really excited to use ES again. Currently ret feels highly rotational, and this is made worse by the fact that we are never building up to anything other than TV chains. I feel that ES would do a lot to spice up the rotation for those of us who are getting bored with the current playstyle with final verdict. As such, I think Cloak of the nathrezim, and possibly even echo of the highlord, should also apply to execution sentence, or maybe just holy power spenders in general.

What I'm not getting is why the dot-echoing that's being added to mind flay couldnt' have been added to Mind Sear. It's not like we're running out of space on our action bars after the ability purge that predated Legion. And as payment for this unwanted adjustment, I now don't have an efficent way to clear large amounts of low-level enemies; my understanding of the new Spriest AoE is that the aoe locus would die either from the first tick of a DoT, or the first tick of mind flay. TLDR: I'm not seeing the benefit of losing Mind Sear. It was stated in the recent blue post that Mind Flay will now serve \"a similar purpose,\" but by my reading it will be strictly inferior for that purpose in a number of situations, and I don't think Priests are so encumbered with buttons to press that we can't deal with having to choose between Flay for single target, and Sear for AoE. Edit: Oh, and Twins' Painful Touch (credit to replies for pointing this out). Being able to strategically hold the Mind Sear to spread DoTs in Voidform was an interesting and useful mechanic.

But it's impossible to do, really. Especially for Sub Rogues who haven't seen a single Blue comment regarding their spec since months before Legion even launched. What percentage of your paying customer base plays Subtlety? Is it thousands? Tens of thousands? Hundreds of thousands? Regardless of what the percentage is, it's legitimately awful that we haven't seen a single developer response to assuage any of our concerns. Some of those concerns being: 1) Energy management during our dance rotations, assuming we are one of the masochistic few who raid with this spec without Satyr's Walk. 2) Lagging behind on single target (again, without a completely RNG legendary) compared to Assassination rogues despite our much higher risk/reward play-style in raids. a) If we blow a dance charge and get targeted with Focused Gaze, or Rot, or anything that requires us to get out of dodge, there's very little way for us to meaningfully recoup charges during a single encounter. b) If we don't manage our shadowstrike buffer zone distance and suddenly the tank moves the target an inch and we teleport into a self or raid compromising position. Does Blizzard not want Sub Rogues in the raid environment? Our raid population numbers, when compared with Assassination Rogues, are paltry. I'd have assumed the goal was to increase those and create a more healthy mix of specs within raids - but maybe I'm wrong. Now our Nighthold 4 piece set bonus has been absolutely gutted, adding a massive amount of RNG into a spec that isn't really supposed to rely on it. To compound the issue it seems that the 4 piece bonus was the only thing that was finally going to improve our quality of life and rotation management (again, assuming we are one of the damned who doesn't have Satyr's Walk). Can we please, for the love of God, get a Blue response for Subtlety Rogues - what are your goals for Subtlety? What is the future to Subtlety? What will be done to address QOL concerns for Subtlety?

{"url": "/forums/en/wow/topic/20752559762", "title": "\"Class Fantasy\" gets a bad rap.", "replies": "26", "first_post": "Whenever I see someone explaining something bad in the game by saying \"class fantasy\"... I die a little on the inside. I feel class fantasy has gotten a bad wrap and has become misunderstood to mean \"badly balanced.\" I just flat out disagree. Bad balance is bad balance. Class fantasy is a limited scope idea that basically served as the overall answer to the awful homogenization that started in Cata and basically peaked in MoP when every class could basically do everything. Dehomogenization should always be a goal... and that's all class fantasy was. Make a warlock feel like a warlock. Make a monk feel like a monk. Give the devil its due: when you're playing a Spriest, you don't feel like a Mage dyed purple. The issue they're running into is what, exactly, they are dehomogenizing. In PvP, for example, it's not a problem that every ranged character has a way to deal with melee. That's just called \"class balance.\" Unless you're going to do something like implement collision detection so you can literally \"form ranks\" and \"stand behind the tanks\"... you cannot have ranged classes that have no way of seperating from melee when they get on them. That's not a class fantasy issue, that's a stupid design issue. I don't want Blizzard to take the wrong message away - that we hate to love homogenization and go back to that route where every class had everything... but you can't skimp on the bare essentials: 1. Every tank needs to be viable. You can't have DHs, DKs and BMs pushing cooldowns to get what Paladins, Guardians, Warriors get by equipping a shield/going into Bear form... even if it is a short cooldown. That's not a class fantasy issue, that's a stupid design issue. 2. Every healer needs to be viable. Disc Priests are fun, but they need to be more accessable. You can't have this spec where if you aren't in the top 90% of healers, you can't make it work. Likewise, in PvP, you can't have 1 spec that can counter melee and all the others who cannot... otherwise you get RBGs looking for 3 Mistweaver monks. Again - not class fantasy. Bad design. 3. Every DPS needs to bring comparable sustained single target and AoE. Before Legion, AoE was a quality of life thing and could be comparable to utility. You could have classes that sucked at it... and that was fine. There was no such thing as a \"timed run\" other than niche Challenge modes no one really did or, if they wanted it badly enough, they just paid for a carry. With Mythic+s, good AoE damage is every bit as important as single target... because progression hinges on it. You CANNOT have Fire Mages and DHers dealing 2-3 million DPS on a trash pack while some specs have to blow every cooldown they have to even have a shot at 500-600k. That's as absurd as giving Mages 5x less single target damage, having them place under the tank in raid fights and saying: \"It's fine - their AoE damage is awesome. Every spec needs to have its weaknesses.\" No... it's not fine. Mages just won't be brought to raids, just like classes with bad AoE don't get brought to Mythic+s... and it doesn't matter if Ion has seen them once in a +15 video. That doesn't mean it's balanced. But the takeaway is: It's not a class fantasy problem that some specs deal crap AoE damage - it's just a stupid design issue. Blizzard, I love your class fantasies - you've made classes feel unique and fun. But you cannot have classes that underperform in core aspects of the gameplay. By the logic you've embraced, you might as well just create a \"Citizen\" class... where you can play the class fantasy of being a commoner in World of Warcraft. The heroic tale of a farmer who's had too much, picked up his pitchfork, and went to go raid the Emerald Nightmare... sure, he might deal 1/10th the damage of someone else, but boy does he feel UNIQUE! This is obviously an exaggeration. Bottom line: you can make classes feel and play unique and honor their class fantasies just fine... just don't give some the short end of the straw when it comes to basic, core gameplay.", "author": "Barrison"}

{"url": "/forums/en/wow/topic/20752589818", "title": "Blue Class Feedback Topics", "replies": "2", "first_post": "Hello, So a day or two ago Blizzard snuck a change to this spell into the PTR that completely changes the functionality of Serenity while also nerfing it. For those unaware, Serenity currently halves the CDs of our abilites when cast and halves the CD of any ability cast during it. For example, if Fists of Fury had a CD of 12 seconds when we activate Serenity, it would drop to a 6 second CD. If we used it during Serenity, instead of being a 24 second CD, it would be a 12 second CD. However, on the PTR, after Serenity ends, the second usage of Fists of Fury results in the CD bouncing back up to the normal amount, so it would be back to around 24 seconds. Not only is this an overall damage nerf, (less casts of FOF, SoWTL, etc), but it also harms the fluid nature of our rotation and makes the rotation overall less fun by reducing the number of big spells we get to cast. This forces us to do more filler ala Black out Kick, Tiger Palm, Flying Serpent Kick, which aren't particuarly enjoyable abilities due to their low damage. Here's an article on WTW about it in case I was mistaken in any of the above information: http://www.walkingthewind.com/2016/12/01/ptr-7-1-5-nov-30-part-3-serenity-changes/ My complaint about this change is not that it's a net dps nerf, but that it's a really unecessary, unfun nerf. There's nothing fun about having to do more filler spells. It also ruins the flow of the rotation, because as of now in a patchwork fight, we can basically use Serenity off cool down without holding anything for more than 5 seconds. With this change, our spells will not line up as well resulting in us having to hold one of our big spells or hold Serenity for a longer period of time. This change seems like a solution in search of a problem; Mr. Babs has suggested this change was made by Blizzard to \"unify\" CDR mechanics, but I fail to see the necessity of this. Serenity is a major cooldown and a max level talent, there is no reason for it to behave like other abilities. How it worked made it unique. If we want to be more uniform, wouldn't it be best to make it a 30% damage increase for 20 seconds like some other classes /s I realize that Blizzard does not care about how much players enjoy the game, and has stated repeatedly they make the game THEIR DEVELOPERS want to play, but this is not a change that will make Windwalker Monks more fun for anyone to play. I refuse to believe there's anywhere close to a majority of people who find hitting less big spells to be fun. Unfortunately due to Blizzard's lack of transparency, we have no idea why this change was made, so we can't give any feedback as to wether or not this meets their goals. All I can say is that I think this is an unnecessary change and the wrong way to nerf Serenity if Blizzard believes the main cooldown of a struggling spec needs to be nerfed. This change doesn't make the class more fun or engaging to play, and I believe that should be the litmus test for most changes as this is a video game. Thanks for reading my ramble and I hope Blizzard is either more transparent about the reason for this nerf or reverts this change and nerfs us in another way.", "author": "Azhurea"}

I liked it. It was fast, controllable (For the most part), and had its rewarding moments if you knew what you were doing. In comes Patch 7.1.5 on the tail of a very successful Blizzcon for WoW after Ion promised us so much content and exciting changes for all classes that made sense while he talked about them. But we got this abomination of a patch that looks to ruin Legion by going back on some of the promises that were made by Blizzard, particularly not making players regret their choice for playing a spec, playing a certain class and above all purchasing the game. As it is, Hunters, Warlocks and Demon Hunters are just flabbergasted at what has happened to their class. I don't blame them. But people have this misconception that Blizzard cares only about Mages because we got some reskins of a single spell, some changes that make no sense. People, Mages aren't any more favored than Warlocks or Hunters because we are getting looked at. It is BECAUSE we are being looked at that terrifies me. Mages might very well be joining the Hunters and Warlocks soon enough. I have only played Fire mage, Disc Priest, Prot/Fury Warrior this expac and I main a Fire Mage. So I cannot speak for Hunters or Warlocks but I can try to show you how much beating we have taken. Major Changes and How it affects the spec: 1. Critical mass(Multiplied Crit chance; passive), Molten Armor(20% Increased crit and damage reduction; passive) and Ice Barrier(a pretty okay shield; active) have all been combined and split into two abilities. Critical Mass(10% flat crit increase with additional flat increase from stats; passive) and Blazing Barrier(Orange garbage shield; active). Effect: While nobody really cares much about the visually updated Blazing Barrier its Critical Mass here that bothers everyone. Because of how much secondary stats have been nerfed in addition to Baseline Crit, our ability to get Hot Streak has become slightly not possible. In effect, we need more crit. 2. Removal of Ice Floes Effect: In addition to the damage nerf of Legendary bracers means, No more fancy casting while moving. We are just another cloth turret who will lose DPS even if they move so much as an inch. We cannot be different from other casters anymore. We just have different visuals. This change Hurts a LOT. 3. Combustion's Mastery and Rune of Power Nerfs. Effect: Combustion has always been a Fire mage's shining moment. particularly in this expac (It's the 7th iteration of this spell. or is it 8 now?). Because of the nature of Ability Synchronisation, Fire is a good burst spec. it's no Shadow Priest but it's okay. This is also the Point I'm most salty about Ion going back on his promise. We were told that other abilities will be beefed up to compete with the Mandatory ability. but what we got was a nerf to the Ability and still better than the others. So no More intense burst phases. 4. Addition of New Legendaries and Scorch. Effect: Scorch is the ONLY ability that you can cast while moving and its garbage. Because the pool of Legendaries are diluted so much and Combustion being only 75% Effective (on its own. combined with other nerfs its only about 48-51% effective in PTR when compared to live), the New Legendary Gloves is MANDATORY and it is going to be hard to obtain. You can't do as much DPS as LIVE in 7.1.5 or Nighthold without it. Overall Effect: Because of all these Nerfs, Right now a good Fire Mage can lose anywhere from 70-100k DPS. No more covering some simple raid mistakes like missed Tentacle soak on Helya. Legendary Bracers are now worser than Prydaz. from BiS to WiS. and no more shining moment. an 850 Item with Crit is now worth way more than 885 with no crit. Why are we playing Fire Mage again? Why are we playing Mages again? Why are we playing Legion again? Proposed Solution: The Simplest Solution is to just revert back the changes to 7.1 and just tweak the numbers. Address only the Specs of certain classes that need slight changes. like Outlaw Rogues and their Roll the Dice (I know its bones but it is RNG). This will be the best choice for most of the specs, like Hunters and Mages. If you wanted to keep the changes, Give us back icefloes, buff ROP and the entire row. not nerf them. and Also. leave Critical Mass and Molten Armor as they are. the overall Secondary stat nerf will be enough to nerf the damage along with Combustion nerf and inability to control Fire Blast. Please Blizzard. Legion has been the best expansion so far. listen to your player base. Don't turn this dream expac into a Nightmare.", "author": "Bris\u00eengr"}

Now I know I'm late to the party, but the patch notes seem to forcing us into a complete 180: Drain Soul is now baseline, and it now heals for half as much. (200% vs 400% on live) Where is Affliction's iconic Drain Life ability? Malefic Grasp is back as a talent that makes your dots do 80% more damage while you're channeling your filler. Haunt increases your dot damage for 15 seconds with a 30 second cooldown. I'll admit the version on live doesn't really seem to be ideal over the other 2 talents in that tier because Drain Soul and Haunt tried to do the same thing (deal extra damage) and Drain Soul did it better. However, now they're both trying to do the same thing again (boost dot damage this time) so...again, only one will be optimal over the other. Seed of Corruption now costs a Soul Shard baseline. Just...why? Is being able to mass-spread corruption (a huge QoL effect) and have some form of reliable AoE really that overpowred? Maybe I'm just griping, and i'm okay with this being nothing more than that, but it seems like in one single patch, we're going from having a really solid spec to having more of the same gimmick-bloated crap we had during WoD. Only this time, we're still stuck using the damned Felhunter because somebody thought that being able to actually choose pets was too fun. Or something.

Here are my logs, I don't suck and have extensive time playing multiple variations of frost at a high level this expansion: https://www.warcraftlogs.com/rankings/character/15984586/10/ First of all, there are many good things I like about frost. I will not be talking about these things. I want to address problems and concerns in a concise and easy to read manner, however I do still love frost, and will continue playing frost over arcane and fire...I am a frost mage. So, lets begin. Single Target DPS Frost single target in a vacuum is fine, more than fine really, you can see we actually sim tops of the charts for patchwerk style 880 gear. However, if you take a look at Guarm Mythic, a patchwerk style fight, you will see it is not frost mages at the top in reality. https://www.warcraftlogs.com/rankings/12#boss=1962 Now frost is not far behind, you would only have to go to page 2 to find Razlopper playing Glacial Spike followed closely by a Ray of Frost build and Bonechilling. You may say, well hold up, how is it simmed at the top if 3 guys are playing 3 different specs? What are they simming for? Well, the answer is Bone Chilling, Incanter's Flow, and Thermal Void. This is the spec beating everything in sims, but in reality it doesn't always work out that way. Now don't get me wrong, I myself have had some amazing pulls on fights running this exact build, but it has flaws. - It is incredibly punishing if there is a break in the action, such as a phase change or too much movement where you run out of ice flows or have a gap in DPS due to changing sides of a room. - It is very inconsistent. This spec sims around 100% uptime for icy veins and assuming you are dumping all of your ice lances into 3x chain reaction. If you get unlucky, this just doesn't happen, and can sometimes be left with a minute and a half of hitting like a wet noodle while you wait for icy veins to come back up. - It relies on the legendary gloves. 1 FoF proc per 10 is really nice to have, and the above problem of consistency can probably be solved by the gloves. I don't know for sure, I don't have them. Which sucks. - This build has absolutely no burst. Don't get me wrong, I love Bone Chilling Thermal Void, it is like juggling while treading water, trying to maintain chain reaction and icy veins...but missing burst damage is definitely a problem with this build. So what about Glacial Spike and Ray of Frost? Ray of Frost and Glacial Spike are both fun builds. Ray of Frost is very bursty on the opener, making it a valuable choice, and less risky option. I have found this spec to be far more consistent than Bone Chilling, I mean how can you screw up popping hero + rune of power + icy veins and then go grab a drink while you channel a 10 second cast. Once you are done with the channel, it is ok if you let icy veins fall. You no longer are forced to maintain it indefinitely, the goal is really just to push icy veins forward 60 seconds to get another Ray of Frost in it. This is easier to do, and if you mess it up it isn't that big of a deal, you get most of your damage from the first Ray of Frost anyways. Glacial Spike is interesting too, as the spec tries to take advantage of shattering as many frostbolts as possible, and gaining value on splitting ice when possible. Another spec where you have a relatively consistent burst rotation, followed by downtime. Alright, so what am I getting at, and what does this have to do with the PTR? Alright, so frost is in a magical spot right now where we actually have meaningful choices and options in our talents. This is absolutely amazing, but with the sweeping changes coming in 7.1.5, it is inevitable that the balance gets tipped one way or another and a dominant \"right\" choice emerges. I don't want this, please keep Ray of Frost and Glacial Spike as meaningful options. Also, Bone Chilling Thermal Void has absolutely the most weaknesses right now in terms of single target, with it being the most punishing and least bursty. Right now the spec plays like a spriest, but if you let icy veins fall off, rather than die, you just do crap DPS until icy veins comes back up again. I am not sure how to fix this problem, or if it even needs to be fixed, but it can be frustrating at times. I hope when the numbers get crunched on the PTR all 3 iterations of frost single target end up in a similar state.", "author": "Hellayna"}

You want to adjust stat priorities to make it so that high ilvl is almost always an upgrade You want to re-evaluate talents that everyone takes and possibly make them baseline Regarding stat priorities, Prot warriors are probably one of the most balanced specs in the game. You aren't going to ever convince all tanks to always take the highest ilvl piece as different tanks have different priorities. Some tanks haste/mastery so that they have the greatest overall damage mitigation. Some tanks stack versatility in order to mitigate all damage, even the spell damage. Some tanks just favor ilvl and stamina in order to prevent getting killed before healers can react. Some tanks just favor outputting the most damage possible, relying on the basic kit in order to obtain a level of mitigation sufficient for content. None of those tanks are wrong, and they all have different stat priorities. Yes, there is a general trend of favoring pieces without crit, but this is due largely to battle cry devaluing crit for 8% of the fight and the heavy diminishing returns on parry. However, even with those downsides some tanks will take the ilvl upgrade due to the increased damage from more stats + more strength and/or the increased stamina combined with the extra free rage from ultimatum. Now, about the talent changes... Devastator is a good idea but is in the wrong row. It is competing with Never Surrender and Indomitable, two talents that are 99% survivability focused. Having a rotation altering talent compete with dedicated survivability talents is a recipe for disaster when it comes to balancing. Devastator should be where Ultimatum currently is. Then you can balance Devastator to be a DPS increase as it is competing with two other pure DPS talents. Now the player has 3 different ways of increasing their damage, one of which allows them to play a non-GCD locked spec. I would even suggest adding rage generation to thunderclap (in addition to reverting the Focused Rage and Revenge changes) so that the Devastator build uses Revenge, Thunder Clap and Shield Slam while the non-Devastator build uses just Devastate, Revenge and Shield Slam. Since the non-Devastator build doesn't use Thunder Clap in it's single target rotation, you can use Thunder Clap as a tuning knob to balance Devastator. This is assuming that Devastator will no longer generate 5 rage per auto if moved to Ultimatum's spot as that would be a very large survivability increase on a DPS tier. As for the current location of Devastator, I would replace it with another pure survivability option. Since the other two talents deal with Ignore Pain, I would continue that pattern. An idea would be a talent that gives us a minor stagger type effect except instead of cleansing the stagger, the dot is minimized or ignored while the Ignore Pain buff is up. Something like \"Pain Tolerance\" 10% of all damage taken is converted into a dot called 'Pain' which lasts for x seconds, damage from Pain absorbed by Ignore Pain is reduced by 75%. This would be another semi-passive survivability talent which can compete with the 25% extra health from Indomitable by reducing the damage taken immediately and has some built in class flavor.", "author": "Kikwar"}

Also, while the old ultimatum/vengeance combo synergized with battle cry/shatter the bones, the current vengeance talent just feel punishing to use without devastator (there's no way to fit revenge in a ST rotation)...

Look, you like alternative viability in builds and you want to make secondary stats have value. Fine. Ok. Here: Rend ->(replaced with)-> Deep Wounds Your critical strikes cause the target to bleed for 20% of the damage done over 6 seconds. This effect is cancelled if the target reaches full health. There you go. You know, that skill that's been part of Warrior's arsenal since 1.0. Now Arms that go the Trauma/Opportunity Strikes path, have a full supportive system in play that puts them on a viability level of Focused Rage builds. - Oh, and look at that, a reason for Crit as Arms instead of stacking haste like Fury. - Oh, that even pairs nicely with how PvP Arms Warriors gear.

{"url": "/forums/en/wow/topic/20752649808", "title": "Suggestions for Improved PTR Communication", "replies": "11", "first_post": "Just to put this out there up front, please try and keep this constructive. I really want to avoid this turning into a \"F* Blizzard\" \"You guys Suck\" \"Unsub to teach them a lesson\" thread. I would like to keep this focused around what Blizz can do to provide better communication specifically with the PTR Cycles (since this is on the PTR Forums). I thought of three to start, that seem to be the most common things i saw throughout the PTR Cycle for 7.1.5 Patch Notes for PTR Builds It seemed like one of the biggest issues with the PTR Cycle was that pretty much the only source we had for build patch notes was third party sites like MMO Champion and WowHead. And that came with frequent communication from Blizzard saying that \"their datamining isnt completely accurate, ignore it\". In my opinion, the class changes and such for a PTR Cycle should be available via official, accurate patch notes directly from Blizzard and we can rely on third party sites for data mining other things like new achievements, new mounts, etc. Personally I really liked the format that the beta cycles had where there was one set of patch notes, and every time a build was released, the notes were updated with the latest changes. Can we get that for PTR Cycles as well? Doesnt need to be anything terribly detailed, just a list of the class changes that we can know is accurate. Cause the alternative is third party sites datamine the changes, Blizzard says their datamine isnt accurate, players get upset about some datamined change, Blizzard has to step in and say that was a tooltip error and it wasnt changed, player gets confused, no one knows what is accurate anymore. Class Specific Goals and Problems you are trying to fix Another major issue I saw throughout the class forums and this forum is that the players have no idea what problems you are trying to fix in the PTR Cycle, so when we see the changes (without any context for the change) we tend to get angry and upset because x was nerfed or some spell was touched when there is another spell that is a bigger issue and then we come here begging for communication because we are lost as to what you are trying to do. In my opinion, if at the beginning of the PTR Cycle, before ANY changes are made to the classes, if you posted something that listed all the specs (or just the ones you are planning on working on) and listed the issues you are trying to fix ... then we would know what you are trying to do so the changes hopefully make more sense. As an example, for mages, if at the beginning of the PTR Cycle you had posted something like the following, i think we would have understood things a little more ... Fire Mage: Too much of Fire's damage is inside the Burst Phase (The Combustion WIndow), we want to take away some of the damage from the Burst Phase and buff up their sustained damage to match Arcane Mage: Quickening dominates the spec and creates a lot of issues. We want to change around Arcane's talent tree so we can balance Quickening with the other options so Quickening isnt a guaranteed choice. Overall Secondary Stats: Secondary Stats have dominated gear too much making them in many cases more valuable than primary stats. We would like to balance this better so that the Item Level/Primary Stats on gear matters instead of an item being worthless because it doesnt have x secondary stat. I believe that something simple like that at the BEGINNING of the patch cycle would make all the difference. With that information, we can focus our feedback around those goals and problems that you posted. So now we can make our feedback relevant to your goals as opposed to just reacting to whatever the latest build had in it. Easily accessible information All of your communication regarding the PTR Cycle should really be posted on the PTR Forums where your testers are going to be able to see it easily. We shouldnt have to follow the PTR Forums, Twitter, Third Party Sites, Q&A's, Developer Interviews (third party interviews), etc. just to be able to get all the info about the PTR Cycle and Changes. Otherwise it turns into \"Well they said this on twitter, and then in this interview with X they said this, the datamined changes said this, and in the Q&A they said this ...\". Its fine if you post things via other mediums, but anything related to the PTR should be posted (or copied) here where it is easily accessible. Those were just a few that i came up with, if anyone else has something they would like to see in regards to communication, feel free to post it. Overall I just think that a LOT of communication concerns can be alleviated by giving some basic info up front instead of halfway through the ptr cycle, or as the cycle is completing (if its given at all). Especially if you want our feedback on changes, we need to know where the goal line is!", "author": "Sharrq"}

Thank you for that - I think the biggest issue that people find here is sometimes voicing opinions, regardless of the manner in which they're phrased, is like an echo chamber without any feedback from the company the develops the game we've all loved for years. Personally, I've been playing since before BWL was released in Vanilla, so I can understand how tumultuous things can get and it's admirable that you are still trying to improve how you communicate to your players. I'll skip right to what I'd like addressed - and there have been many threads concerning this issue. Disc just isn't very viable in 3v3. It's certainly Glad capable in the hands of a select few players, but it certainly doesn't bring almost anything to the table that other healers don't already provide. A couple concerns that should be looked into or at least responded to: Disc has the worst crowd control of any healer and that's including Mind Control. Keep in mind MC is still intermittently buggy to where leveraging it in a game can prevent using Penance, Trinket, etc. for the duration of the match. Also MC essentially CCs the casting Disc as well, which seems really punishing for one of the healers with the fewest catch up mechanics. We can't spend time channeling an MC because without a CD coming out of it, we can't catch back up typically. Psychic Scream also requires melee range, and although it has a relatively short CD and is AoE, you've kept Disc as the healer with by far the least mobility (even with Feathers, which aren't a very 'fun' mechanic in my opinion). I find that in 2s games or the small amount of 3s games I've forced myself to q this season I can barely even reach an opposing healer to fear them. Something should be done to bring Disc's crowd control in line with healers or at least give them meaningful and trustworthy mobility. Many talents (honor and otherwise) are pretty underwhelming. Blizzard has said that if there are talents everyone is taking they are looking at baking those talents into the spec. Archangel is a great example of this, as it's a prerequisite healing CD. Outside of maybe some outlier RMP, WWDK or maybe WWMP - no one is taking Dark Archangel because we don't have enough healing throughput to keep anyone upright even when our opponents aren't using their offensive CDs. If we eat one crowd control effect we better have Archangel coming out of it, or we'll end up really far behind. Another few good examples would be The Penitent, Psychic Voice, Mind Bender, and Grace. I want to specify that I don't think anything other than perhaps Psychic Voice and the Penitent would have any reason to be baked into Discipline's kit - just that the other talents alongside all of the aforementioned abilities typically don't keep up in Arena. Lastly, and this has been the case for some time now, the throughput on Divine Star and Halo is pretty abysmal. I remember a while back (could have been a few years now) reading a post from Blizzard about talented abilities being designed so they are a fun button to press. Personally, while Halo has it's place in PvE, none of them are typically exciting. Clarity of Will is okay, but usually our Atonement throughput isn't high enough to top someone while the shield prevents them from dipping lower. That's one of my biggest gripes, I think, is that in PvP Disc was designed initially to be offensive (I'm talking back to LK days with double offensive dispel, for example) and they had mechanics like PW: Shield in order to prevent further damage while they were being offensive and nuking with Mind Blast. Now, PW: Shield doesn't have things like D. Aegis, Mending, Renew, etc to prevent instantly being dispelled - and the actual shield itself is moderately weak when compared to burst.", "author": "Narthypoo"}

I have been following the forum posts for balance druids for months now. Out of all the changes I have seen, it feels like none of our suggestions have been taken into consideration. Ignoring the fact that our single target is middle of the pack at best, the only thing you focused on was talent changes to the AoE talents. These changes don't feel like they address the issues for our lack of AoE damage. The biggest thing we needed was a baseline buff, and all we got was a measly 4% to counter the fact that the ED helm was nerfed. Starfall is not in a good place, and to call echoing stars a gold dragon node is frankly, an insult. Echoing stars got a buff from 8.6% to 11% spell power. It hits one extra target at my current ilvl for about 3800. How is this a buff? You have real aoe classes like fire mages, DH's, and monks doing way more damage because their spells actuall hit for a good amount to all targets instead of 1 extra for 3800. I am not expecting every class to be equal in every aspect, but we simply can not compete at all for AoE dps. It was virtually not an increase to our dps, and was a wasted node in our artifact. Taking the new talents for AoE will only marginally increase our AoE dps but make our single target suffer severely, so why do it? My point is, out of all the brilliant ideas that could buff our AoE without taking a hit to our single target, none of them even came close to being a change. It not only feels like we are being ignored completely, it feels like people with a complete lack of balance druid knowledge is in charge of changing us.

This also means we get less overall IP cast; since we hardly ever use revenge, we hardly ever get a cost reduction on IP... previously we could use FR-IP out of the GCD... not anymore. with 31% haste + into the fray AND devastator i can barely keep shield block up... more like a 90% uptime depending on proc rate... thing is, without indomitable my IP are soo weak it's laughable... what the heck am-i gonna do wit a 800k IP when mythic guarm autoattack for 2 million? that's ridiculous. ilvl889 btw. Battle cry is now kinda useless... can't use it to get a big IP anymore, can't use it to 'burst' either (no more FR...no more 2 million shield slams...) So in the end, we have to stack haste even harder, likely over near 40% haste if we want a 100% shield block without devastator (which is a 25% hp/IP nerf), we cast less IP overall... oh and, I went from sustain 280-300k dps to sub 250k. if any tank cared about dps. my one and only mythic dungeon so far went horrible... thunderclap isn't enough to hold aggro (well, it's skittish) and I can't get enough rage to revenge... because i don't have aggro.

Now comes 7.1.5 in which a headscratching/unnecessary OoC change makes our rotation harder and clunkier than ever; our set bonuses make no sense (2p is a 0% increase), we receive a nerf to our rip relics; our JW, SR, BT talent options will still remain to be selected 99.99% of the time (so much for baked in); we lose utility on our displacer beast; we get our new legendary wasted on Maim (ROFLLOLOL); 5% nerf to crit (cya CP gen); and to top it all off, all of the concerns that we've had since alpha and beta still remain ignored. Our appalling AoE is supposedly because we're a ST niche yet multiple mouth-breather specs outdo us in both departments. We're referred to as the most difficult spec to play; yet risk reward is currently non existent.

Originally posted here: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20752169010 There are a couple quality of life changes for Discipline Priests that most of the community would like to see, so I wanted to put it in one place for everyone to comment on and discuss so that we can maybe see some positive outcomes. DPS Filler We need a \"free\" (no mana cost) DPS spell that doesn't proc Atonement. Smite is a great ability, but spamming it as a filler is not effective in a raid setting. It is a drain on mana, however, it is extremely important to our healing rotation since it's our DPS filler for Atonement bursts. Right now, as a Discipline Priest, we spend much of the fight between major AoE not casting anything besides Penance and PW:S, which are both on cooldown for a period of time. Changing Smite to be mana free and having no proc to Atonement would effectively be a nerf to Disc. A new spell would need to be added. We need a Shadow spell added to the spec that can fill in some GCD gaps that Disc currently has (Mind Blast / Mind Flay maybe?). One of the problems with Disc right now is we sit around wasting a lot of GCD's by not casting when it's not necessarily productive. People newer to the spec gravitate towards spamming Smite during low damage periods of an encounter and it results in them having mana issues. I think, as a community, we all want a more active play-style. Having another ability to use to fill in those gaps would be excellent. (optional) Disc also could use some form of AoE that doesn't proc Atonement. Holy has Holy Nova which is an extremely mana efficient AoE ability, but Disc has nothing (not counting talents like Divine Star / Halo as actual AoE). I think giving Disc Priests Mind Sear would solve some of our issues with contributing AoE damage in periods of low incoming damage during dungeons / raids. Trinkets As many aren't aware (since Discipline is a rather under represented spec at the moment), Disc received a nerf to the damage of DPS trinkets earlier in the expansion. This nerf essentially made any DPS trinket obsolete and basically vendor trash. The problem with this is that they still remain on our loot table, and there is a chance that we can get them in our M+ cache, M+ chests, boss drops, coining on a raid boss, etc. The alternative is we could set our loot spec to Holy, but then we will get Holy legendaries instead Discipline. Our request is that you either make DPS trinkets worth taking for Disc, or you remove them from our loot table. Thank you for reading, and I hope to see a great and lively discussion regarding these QoL changes that are needed for our spec.", "author": "M\u00e8nd"}

Honestly the fall of Subtlety Rogues was the addition of Shadowstrike, this ability should never have been turned into our main attack to generate CP. We should have kept Backstab as our main CP builder, and Gloomblade as the secondary. 2. Shadow Dance should not have 3 charges, it should only have 1 charge at a 60 sec CD with an 8 sec last period, Shadowstrike should be our \"use while stealth, or while Shadow Dance is active\" ability, much like Ambush. 3. Symbols of Death should never have been introduced to the game, an ability with almost no CD and provides a consistent 20% overall damage buff is ridiculous, the 20% damage should be baked into the class, and Enveloping shadows should take the place of Symbols of Death. 4. Deeper Stratagem should never have given a 5-10% damage increase to finishing moves, this should be baked into the spec, and allows the other level 45 tier Talents to be viable. 5. If Shadow Dance was adjusted back to a 60 sec CD, Subterfuge should be baked into Stealth for Subtlety Rogues, allowing the use of abilities which require stealth for an additional 2 seconds. I've no idea why the Talent Subterfuge exists, but because it does, it makes the other 2 level 30 tier Talents useless. 6. Feint should not be getting an energy cost increase after 12 years. 7. Slows should not be reduced to 30% across the board. 8. Instanced PVP damage should not be reduced by 55% across the board. 9. Poisons should be part of all Rogues Specs 10. Gouge should be part of all Rogue Specs 11. Subtleties biggest damage dealer, and only slow is Nightblade, this ability should not be cleansable, not only does it drop the damage completely, but it drops our slow, it's not like we can spam it like Assassination can with their Crippling Poison. Hence another reason why Poisons should be part of all Rogue Specs. Remove slow from Nightblade, at least give back Crippling Poison to all Rogue Specs. Blizzard does not know how to properly balance a class, they said they wouldn't be doing a number changes to fix the class issues, they said they would bake highly use abilities into the \"Class\", not just the spec. And they only did this for Blind, and Hunter Traps. All I see for Rogues is, number and % changes to Legendaries, Abilities, and Talents. Yes Subtlety does fine in PVE now, but next patch since our boots were nerfed, this will not be the case, we are now very energy starved while using Deeper Stratagem. And issues within instanced PVP is still unchanged, we still have a 55% damage decrease. I feel completely lied to.", "author": "Phay"}

On live, I have 44% crit and 118% mastery. On PTR I have 37% crit and 110% mastery. This change does literally nothing to encourage people to take iLvl upgrades over secondary stats.

Please, Blizzard, adjust this useless change and try to approach it in another manner, like adding primary stats to jewelry.

I'm a hardcore Everquest 2 raider who raided in top 3 ranked guilds, played various mmos along the way, bought every single WoW expansion but never managed to get attached to any of them until Legion. I'm loving Legion but I feel like I'm being forced to quit playing. So here is the short version of what happened. I started playing in Legion, rolled a warrior, decided i had a lot of fun with Arms spec, got to max level, started raiding, started doing mythic+, doing all my dailies. I realized even though I'm doing everything i can, raiding heroics, mythics, doing mythic +10/11/12s my gear level is falling behind. I researched my class, looked up WoW logs looked at what top players are doing, my rotation is similar, my spec is correct, one thing i noticed was that every single warrior in the top 100 rank had something in common, they all have the legendary gloves and legendary ring (execute ring and rage refund gloves) Well isn't that a coincidence. Well I waited out my luck, I played the game, i did every thing, all my dailies, i would run mythic+ after mythic+ and get gold and artifact power at the end ....and then my weekly reward would be a piece that isn't even a upgrade or a piece that was a side grade, GREAT have to wait another week for ONE item that may or may not be useful. I run mythics, I get gold, from every boss, rarely ever get a piece of gear. Then FINALLY a legendary drops for me, guess what, it's the boots! YES i get a little run speed, compared to the top wariors who all get execute procs and refund rage on mortal stike. Well i figured ok ..this sucks ...but i will compromise i will play another class that also enjoy. So I rolled a DK, paid for another boost, i noticed i loved Unholy, this time i did my research and saw unholy was doing horrific on damage parses. Whatever i liked the class, i started playing it, knowing i will get a legendary soon, i realized the class is virtually unplayable without the bracer legendary and even with them they are still bottom of the food chain. I figured this system cannot possibly last, it's CLEARLY broken so i keep playing in hopes of change. A legendary drops for my DK, guess what, i got the !@#$ty ring that every 30 seconds if im lucky enough to be fighting something i can stun i will get a tiny bit of haste for 10 seconds .....how is this even a legendary???? At this point I'm extremely frustrated, i can't compete with players who have BiS legendaries and have gotten lucky with their titanforged drops, on top of my bad luck, both my classes are so heavily depended on their legendary drops that without are performing way below the standards. I spent my whole holiday break playing my DK in hopes i'd get lucky, not hoping to kill that tough boss we have been working on, not hoping to get a mythic +15 ....just hoping to get LUCKY. Last week I ran a +11 with a undergeared group, we toughed it out, took us 2 hours to get through vaults, but we did it, it was tough but fun, at the end ...i got gold. GOLD. came out empty handed. Then literally 5 minutes later a guild mate completed a world quest solo in 3 minutes and got a lvl 890 relic, HOW??? after hundreds of mythic+ and raids i still dont have a 890 relic ....how could this system so clearly broken still not be fixed??? In all my life playing MMOs at hardcore and casual levels, i have never seen a loot and progression system this broken. I have never been so punished for having bad rng luck. I was SURE that Blizzard sees the problems, i was confident you would address these issues yet here comes 7.1.5 and nothing has been addressed. I don't get rewarded for completing hard content, i don't get rewarded for playing the game. Only viable way to play this game right now is to quit your job, roll 8-9 lvl 110s run dailies on each every day, and whichever one that gets lucky and gets a BiS legendary you can play it as your main and HOPE to the RnG gods that your weekly caches give you useful items or else you will be running round after round after round of mythic+ and come out empty handed. Run mythic raids, spend 4 hours progression on a boss and get gold as drop ....ridiculous. I don't want to quit playing, but at this point ...what choice do i have?", "author": "Zhouy\u00fc"}

{"url": "/forums/en/wow/topic/20752507967", "title": "Disc PVP Changes", "replies": "2", "first_post": "While I posted most of this on the Arena forums (getting lost with thread spams of PVP title handouts, I guess I time things poorly), I'd like to put my input on the PTR forums for more perhaps more and better feedback before things go live. In general, Disc healing in PVP is weak. In 2s however, Disc is strong because of its ability to take more advantage of doing damage/healing with atonement because of less damage output in the bracket. Basically the more enemies/damage there is going out, the worse Disc gets. For a list of things on live servers, basic Priest problems in PVP include: lowest mobility of all the healers, weak healing output (mostly in AOE, PTR changes helping a lot with this), weaker cc (only healer with only 1 cc DRing tree, though perhaps not really a bad thing for the game), and weak dispel protection (not sure best way for fixing this or if it should just be ignored balanced around it). I would like to begin by going over each talent row and my opinion on what/how to fix them. Basic Talents: Row 1: Penitent should be baseline, have Purge the Wicked replace its spot and do some #s tuning on this row with it. Row 2: Mostly fine, however feather and body and soul feel weak in PVP as priest has the worst mobility of all the healers. Masochism on PTR with 10% damage reduction included feels fine. With the other changes I\u2019ll be listing, changing this row too much could be over the top. Row 3: In general, I think Psychic scream should just be a baseline 30 sec cd. Shining Force is a niche talent but I think its fine on this tier already (45 sec cd on PTR vs 1 min on live). With 30 sec CD scream, change Psychic Voice to be a ranged targetable scream with a cast time and an added 15 sec cd (this could possibly be too strong however). As Dominant Mind currently does nothing in PVP, my idea for changing it would be it to have a 2 min cd still, but have it cause a target to have reverse targeting (can\u2019t attack enemies, can only attack allies) for 5 seconds. Row 4: Shield Discipline is still worthless in PVP but overall this talent row can stay as its mostly PVE based/balanced. Row 5: Another mostly PVE impacting row. Twist of Fate with Defender of the Weak is mostly my personal preference for talent combination anymore because of the weak healing output in PVP, but with some numbers tuning, I could see Power Infusion getting more usage again. Contrition still mostly worthless in PVE and PVP imo. Row 6: Divine star is pointless in PVP as the output is almost not worth the global to use it, but overall the row can stay the same. Row 7: Grace is too mandatory. Without it, healing is terrible in both PVP and PVE (I know Purge is used a bit in raiding). It\u2019d be nice to get Grace baseline (Purge the Wicked moved to r1 as mentioned before) and have 2 other talents replace this row so it doesn\u2019t feel too cookie cutter. I don\u2019t really know what to replace them with though, perhaps something to boost atonement healing passively and something else? PVP talents: Row 1: The PVP trinket row is overall fine and perhaps needs no changes. If anything, my personal opinion is to put Relentless back to 25% and disable racial abilities in rated PVP (Allow them in Random BGs/WPVP though, more on this below in general changes) Row 2: I\u2019d like Inner Renewal to be removed as it\u2019s taken mostly for 2s, and when it\u2019s taken, it just drags games out. I don\u2019t know of a good replacement talent for it though. Row 3: I\u2019m fine with this row of talents, though Spiritual Cleansing is a bit RNGish and niche usage. Row 4: I think the redesign of this row on the PTR is about perfect. The new talent Trinity (20% atonement boost, atonement added via plea and lasts 15 seconds longer) is nice vs non-mage/hunter/shaman teams. Searing Light can still be used for 2s. I sort of feel Premonition should be off the GCD due to how GCD locked Disc playstyle is, but unsure if it should happen. Row 5: I like the redesign here as well, though Ultimate Radiance (Power Word: Radiance gets a CD but becomes instant with a large heal output) with combined Trinity may cause it to outshine the other talents in the row due to the large massive and instant AOE healing (This may need to be nerfed with a longer CD). I\u2019d like to see Dome of Light maybe reduce Pain Suppression CD and/or reduce the damage reduction as well. 4 min CD Pain Suppression baseline is terrible and makes it one of the worst defensive CDs in the game imo. Row 6: Power Word: Fortitude needs to be undispellable. Bake in something like a passive 5% healing increase to targets affected by it and it should be good to go. This would allow it to compete with Archangel and Dark Archangel. Dark archangel is pretty niche of a talent so I\u2019d be hesitant to change it too much with a constantly changing meta. Any constructive feedback on all this would be great and I'll update it as needed.", "author": "Dart"}

These changes are massive and will take a huge toll on the playability of the class in PvP and to a lesser extent world PvE and 5 man dungeon utility. These changes are so harsh, the players NEED to know Blizzards reasoning for this. Why are rogue snares being reduced to heavily, but other classes keep 50% snares? Considering how mediocre rogues are right now, not being top dogs in damage output or tankability, or mobility for that matter, this utility and gap closing tool needs to stay at 50% Why was this done? The feint nerf is equally as baffling. Feint is used in conjunction with the talent elusiveness as a rogue's lifeblood to be able to survive for more than a few seconds while being attacked in PvP. Rogues are generally thought of as one of the easiest classes to burst down and kill, and increasing Feints energy cost so drastically will really just make us unable to enter a melee fight altogether. If the talent was considered too good, why not buff the other talents in the row?

However, the one thing that irks me the most, is the change to Omen of Clarity. While I see the idea you are going for, I don't think it's as productive to just go straight for those 3 abilities. Rotation wise, Omen is just a way of speeding up the class playstyle, which is needed because Feral plays so slowly. On the PTR, when I get a proc for omen but I don't have enough energy pooled to rake, I have to wait for the energy to pool back for rake so I can then Rip on the same Blood Talons proc. Overall makes it a lot more clunky to use, in my experience. Suggested Changes: Omen of Clarity causes your next *non-finisher ability* to be free of cost. Being able to utilize things like Moonfire and Rake as part of my Blood Talons rotation without energy pooling as hard will make it a lot easier on me - while at the same time not wasting the proc on a 25 energy bite or a 30 energy rip. Edit: Make Savage Roar baseline, then put MoC on par with Incarn and Soul of the Forest. We would just have to give them brainfood for a talent to replace MoC in that same tier. Maybe bring back Lacerate and put it on par with the other two talents? \"Deals [1+61.6% of AP] Bleed Damage and an additional [25.6% of AP] over 15 seconds. Stacks up to 3 times.\" - Copying from the MoP abilities, just adjust the math to make it scale off of our Mastery for the DoT and allow us to stack another bleed? Make it generate 1 CP rather than reset the CD on Maul, and just give us something else to play with in the Blood Talons tier.

Why was Omen of Clarity changed in the first place and could we possibly see this change reverted? At the moment, it works very well to quicken your rotation when energy starved. With the change on the PTR, only being able to use it on Shreds in single target means that any skill OTHER than that will have to wait. Savage Roar (40 energy), Shred (40 energy), Rake (35 energy), Rip (30 energy), and even Ferocious Bite (25+25 additional energy) all benefited from OoC procs because it would quicken your rotation. It gave you the opportunity to burn a spender at 5CP when you were energy starved from building CP, or it allowed you to use that quick Rake to keep the uptime high, as examples. Being stuck with only Shred using OoC procs makes an already complicated rotation even more clunky, as you'll never be able to jump forward in every situation like you can now.

In it's current state on the PTR the Demonic build heavily relies on Demon's Bite's RNG to generate fury in order for us to keep pumping out Chaos Strikes and Eyebeams. This is a serious issue especially when we don't have a form of passive fury generation outside of Demonic Appetite to fuel our rotation. If DA doesn't proc we are sent scrambling to gather as much fury as we can for our next spender. To me, this is not satisfying gameplay. I like the concept of the Demonic build and I REALLY want to enjoy it but I can't when i'm put into an RNG stranglehold. So I have to ask; are there any plans to remedy this in the future?", "author": "Eradros"}
{"url": "/forums/en/wow/topic/20752366282", "title": "Q&A MM Hunters - Potential Fix", "replies": "4", "first_post": "This post is meant to clarify the misunderstanding between players and blizzard about what\u2019s happening to MM hunters, while also trying to fix rotation and dps performance. I\u2019m not talking about tuning, just trying to get things straight. What players want; What Blizzard wants; What\u2019s happening now and possible solutions. Blue posts and players are also welcome to clarify any misleading information. CLARIFICATION Q: What\u2019s wrong with MM? Why is Blizzard changing it? R: Vulnerable debuff too strong for aoe, but not that competitive ST. Q: Why are the PTR changes so bad [BUILD 23038]? R: Because the currently changes guts aoe to a not satisfactory level, while not adressing the ST problems. In other words a nerf to our overall dps on live. Let\u2019s not forget the gameplay design is terrible (RNG dependant). Q: What\u2019s THAT problem everyone is talking about? Is only about DPS loss? R: While the actual sidewinders/patient sniper rotation are mandatory for a top dps performance, some players didn\u2019t like it\u2019s gameplay (nor the baseline one). Also choosing SW/PS is like cheating the vulnerable mechanic, because you force it\u2019s activation to gain it\u2019s full benefit regardless of the fight situation (AOE and ST). Forcing a vulnerable debuffs TO ALL TARGETS and increasing damage taken by 150% doesn\u2019t feels right for Blizzard. Q: So, in other words, Blizzard failed on MM's rotation and tuning (design)? R: Technically and philosophically yes, Blizzard failed. What I can see is: 1 \u2013 Blizzard tried to give baseline MM hunters a Colossus Smash rotation with Titanic Might (a version that no sane arms warriors would pick), but \"fixed\" with SW/PS talents that works like a Colossus Smash that\u2019s baseline for arms, with a significant burst for AOE, and no downsides. In short, people HATE this kind of rotation (big damage increase tied on a target), because outside of the debuff window, your dps sucks, and for aoe, is even worse. It\u2019s just a nightmare to balance this. 2 \u2013 On Live\u2019s rotation the talents choice is gone, because vulnerable debuff on demand is better than rng. Every sane dps player like to have CONTROL of it\u2019s character gameplay. Instead of giving players CONTROL baseline, Blizzard is giving CONTROL via 2 talents (SW/PS), if they nerf one of them, you\u2019re a dead spec (What's happening now). Q: What about the spec gameplay flavour? What\u2019s a potential fix? R: People don\u2019t like RNG, if you want a proc, it\u2019s preferable to be on a talent. Having CONTROL on your burst is crucial, it\u2019s one of the things that differs bad and good players. One thing to note is that, unfortunately the vulnerable mechanic (or colossus issue) has to stay, because it\u2019s not a patch to redesign na entirelly spec, but to modify the actual rotation. So we have to do something with this vulnerable debuff. That said, the main thing to do is to remove the rng on Hunter's Mark proc, and add some variation to a talent. ROTATION REBALANCE So initially I think the best way to solve this is a building up mechanic, the Hunter hits the target with it\u2019s shots, targets get vulnerable, next shot becomes powerful. So, the new rotation will be: Arcane Shot (ST) and Multi-shot (AOE) applies Hunter\u2019s Mark for a 100% chance. Hunter\u2019s Mark enables Marked Shot. Marked Shot consumes Hunter\u2019s Mark and aplies Vulnerable. Vulnerable increases the damage of your next Aimed Shot and Multi-shot by 100%, Vulnerable is CONSUMED IN THE PROCESS. Make Vulnerable tuning for AOE and ST RIGHT HERE, DON'T MESS WITH IT ANYMORE. Marked Shot will generate focus, Arcane Shot and Multi-shot are only ACTIVATORS FOR FOCUS REGENERATION and damage debuff AKA Marked Shot. In short: [ST] Arcane Shot > Marked Shot > Aimed Shot > REPEAT ; [AOE] Multi-shot > Marked Shot > Multi-Shot > REPEAT Pretty simple, no RNG, balance numbers and focus, with a little build up. Rotation fixed. Now let\u2019s spice it up with talents and artifact. Windburst: Stays the same, but aplies Vulnerable right of the bat. Use it on CD. Rotation: [ST] Windburst > Aimed Shot > Arcane Shot > Marked Shot > Aimed Shot > REPEAT ; [AOE] Multi-shot > Marked Shot > Multi-Shot > REPEAT", "author": "Dimmuaim"}

Does this also mean the promise of baking in the talents that are taken at near 100% are also not going to have anything done to them and SR/JW/BT is going to be mandatory still?

{"url": "/forums/en/wow/topic/20752519426", "title": "New Design Models for Blizzard", "replies": "5", "first_post": "I know that designing is difficult and that its even more challenging for devs to figure out exactly what customers want. Because of the way that item and artifact progression are in this expansion it's more important than ever before that EVERY SINGLE spec is enjoyable to play for the types of players that play those specs and that the numbers balance is decent. I want to propose some new methods that Blizzard can use to gather metrics and decide what to work on. Community Voting Devs gather up a list of their ideas and some highly voted community ideas, send out mail to every player of that class regardless of level with a link asking which talents, spells, etc seem the most interesting. Make sure to tell us what the rotation looks like so we can have an idea of what sort of encounters you imagine for us and our role in them. Next do the same thing but for what we dislike about the class/spell/spec. Once you have that have a data analyst (intern who can use excel) put this in a spreadsheet and then make another post for the community to review about your plans. Give it a week or two, let some discussion build. Then take a minute and make something great, do 10/10 work. Make the game so good that some poor kid has to drop out of college, I believe in you. I believe in the Blizzard devs! Community Manager for Each Spec Imagine a world where Affliction Warlock has a community manager, Ret Paladin has one, everyone else has one; the only requirements? This person is literate and has played that class for a minimum of 3 expansions in the history of Warcraft, better yet give every spec 2 community managers that fight for that spec and represent the players. Have someone who is personally invested in every single spec so that every single class can feel fun and interesting maybe even *feel* overpowered without actually being overpowered. Careful Balancing I'm sure that you guys know how much damage you expect a class to be doing. So instead of completely overbuffing and gutting specs how about you just love tap everything until its where you want it. Shadow Priest doing 400k damage when you want people doing 300k but its fun to play. Then don't change anything but numbers. Take their top 3 damaging abilities and nerf them by the percentage it takes to get them to 300k. Ret Paladin doing 270k when you expect them to do 300k, buff the underused talents a little bit so they have some more choices, buff their weakest attacks by 20% so they are doing the amount you want them to. Talk with us not at us A lot of the people who play your game have been with you guys for a decade or longer. They* should be treated like family. They shouldn't be talked at, they should be communicated with. If you try and homogenize every class/spec and take away all the flavor then no one is going to love your game. Its much more important that people love a class than that no one hates a class. I play Affliction Warlock, people don't enjoy it the way I do, many people prefer to see large crits and have huge awesome plate armor or be a mage with fireballs and whatever. I like being an evil little gnome that bleeds his enemies to death slowly while striking extremely ironic fear into them. But I love the class. I love my race, I love my spec. And my spec deserves someone who will fight for it, so does everyone else. Please Blizzard help us to trust you guys again. Do you guys know how badly we want to have you guys do it right so we can just drizzle non stop praise on you until the next expansion? We aren't on the forums to complain, we are on the forums so that you guys can improve what you are doing so that we can give you guys the respect you deserve.
